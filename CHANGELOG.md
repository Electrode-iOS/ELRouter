# [2.0.0](https://github.com/Electrode-iOS/ELRouter/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

## Breaking 

- Made `routeByName` a private API. Use `routeByEnum` instead.

## New Features

- Added `routeByEnum(routeEnum:) -> Route?` API that returns a single route for a give route enumeration.
- Added `.Alias` route type that returns an existing route to be used in place of this route.

## Fixes

- Increased asynchronous test timeouts to 15 seconds to reduce false negative results on some testing hosts.

- Static routes now call `popToRootViewController` if the route's viewController is a `UINavigationController`.

- Refactor unit tests - Unit tests were not waiting for full completion. By waiting on processing, the exection of routes would tickle the main thread and cause the unit tests to continue running before the Routerâ€™s processing thread was completed, killing any future routes.

# [1.0.1](https://github.com/Electrode-iOS/ELRouter/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

## Fixes

- Added missing call to `injectRouterSwizzles()` in Router init, fixing stuck locked routes
